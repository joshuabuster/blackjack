Basic Rules :
* The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
* Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
* Both dealer and player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
* To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
* If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
* If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
* Blackjack means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet.
* Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.

# Next Steps:

* Add double down feature
* Add a split feature
* Add animations for dealing cards
* Add sound effects for bust or being dealt blackjack
* Add a high scores feature
